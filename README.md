# Machine Learning Sessions

The purpose of these sessions is to provide a quick high-level introduction to Machine learning We will cover both Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks, also we will cover transfer Learning

## Sessions summary:

* [Session 1](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/tree/master/session-1/README.md "Session 1"): 
   Introduction to Machine Learning, building examples showing how to use TensorFlow to approximate a simple linear function, a quadratic function, and XOR.

* [Session 2](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/tree/master/session-2/README.md "Session 2"): 
   We will build an example to recognize the type of a chart from an image that include the chart. We will cover How to load images and prepare them to be suitable for use in Neural NEtwork training.
   
* [Session 3](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/blob/master/session-3/README.md "Session 3"):
   How can we improve the accuracy of the chart recognizer built did in session 2, by using Convolutional Neural Network. We will also show how this reduces the model size dramatically and speeds up training.
   
* [Session 4](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/blob/master/session-4 "Session 4"):
   How using transfer learning techniques can improve the accuracy of our chart recognizer we built-in session 3, and make the training process go faster.
   
* [Session 5](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/blob/master/session-5 "Session 5"):
   How can we combine different pre-trained models to improve the accuracy of our model without adding new training samples.
