# Machine Learning Sessions

The purpose of these session is to provide a quick high level introduction to Machine learning
We will cover both Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks, also we will cover transfer Learning

## Sessions summary:

* [Session 1](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/tree/master/session-1 "Session 1"): 
   Introduction to machine Learning, building examples showing how to use tensorflow to approximate a simple linear function, a quadratic function and XOR.

* [Session 2](https://github.com/mohmiim/MLIntroduction/tree/master/session-2 "Session 2"): 
   We will build an example to recognize the type of a chart from an image that include the chart. We will cover How to load images and prepare them to be suitable for use in Neural NEtwork training.
   
* Session 3:
   We will show how we can improve the accuracy of our chart recognizer we built in session 2, by using Convolutional Neural Network. We will also show how this reduce the model size dramatically and speeds up training.
   
* Session 4:
   We will show how using transfer learning techniques we can improve the accuracy of our chart recognizer we built in session 3, and make the training process really really fast
