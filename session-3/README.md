## 1. What is Convolutional Neural Network

We went through how single neuron and multi neuron (multi layers as well) neural networks work, one observation you will see is that layers in neural networks are fully connected. Meaning that every node in one layer is connected to all nodes in the layer before it  and eveyr node in the layer after it (Hence the layer type we used in tensorflow is called Dense). 

The fully connected nature of Neural network does have few effects that we should understand
