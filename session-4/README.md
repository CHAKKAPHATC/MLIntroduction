## 1. Accuracy so far and how to improve it

So far we managed to get accuracy in the range of 70% (+/- 3), which is OK but not great. It is a good time to think why is that why we do not have better accuracy?  It is All about data, our training sample is too small compared to the problem we are trying to tackle. Oh, OK then lets have more samples, this is easier said than done, deep learning has hunger to data and getting clean labeled samples is time and money consuming task.

What if there is a way to automatically manufacture samples automatically ?
